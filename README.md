# Space-Dynamics
Space dynamics code written at university

scaleheight: plots how air density varies with scale height.

gravsun: finds the gravitational force of the Sun (or any object defined in planetparameters) at the current posistion.
transfereqns: applies the equations of motion (under gravity). 
planetparameters: mass and radius parameters of the object being orbited. (current Moon).
tranfer: plots Earth-Mars Hohmann transfer orbit.
transfer2: plots Earth-Saturn Hohmann transfer orbit.

gravmoon: finds the gravitational force of the Moon (or any object defined in planetparameters) at the current posistion.
transfereqns2: applies the equations of motion (under gravity). 
transfer3: plots the hyberbolic orbit of a probe from the lunar surface to 6 radii out.
(planetparameters)

planetparameters2: mass and radius parameters of the object being orbited. (current Sun).
transfereqns3: applies the equations of motion (under gravity). 
transfer4vf: plots the grand tour of hte solar system using Hohmann transfer orbits.
(gravsun)

lam2 and lam3: tests to Lambert theory.

centreofmass2: calculates the centre of mass of hte configuration (1st config).
iss: works out the moment of inertia matrix for the mass distribution and works out hte eigen- vectors and values.
centreofmass3: for 2nd configuration
centreofmass4: sets and the checks the mass configuration is the the centre of mass frame.
iss2: for 2nd config.
